Hello Bar WP makes it easy for you to convert visitors by adding an attractive and easily customizable conversion bar to the top or bottom of your site.

== Description ==

Quickly add a powerful Hello Bar to your site and start converting visitors. Grab your visitor’s attention with an attractive opt-in bar displayed at the top of your site, and direct them either to product page, signup page, or newsletter subscribe page.

Hello Bar WP is completely responsive and designed to look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Customize options of your bar to adhere to your brand standards. Choose from a multitude of colors (preset or custom), bar styles, and button styles.

= Browser Compatibility List =

While ideally Hello Bar WP would work perfectly in every browser, outdated browsers can cause bars to look unattractive or display inconsistently across different devices. As such, we have opted to not display any bar to users using older browsers, instead of showing them one of lower quality.

Hello Bar WP **should** display perfectly on the following browsers. Users viewing your site on browsers not on this list will simply cannot see your conversion bar.

* Google Chrome 4+
* Firefox 3.5+
* Safari 3.1+
* Internet Explorer 10+

If you notice any inconsistencies in the way your bars display to visitors using these browsers, please let us know [here](https://afterimagedesigns.com/contact-us/) and we will do the best we can to fix the issue.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

###Hello Bar is not showing up in the correct place. What should I do?
or…
Hello Bar is messing up my header. What should I do?

Due to the nature of displaying a bar at a fixed position at the top section of a site, some page layouts will inherently not “play nice” with a fixed bar at the top of the page. Either they use fixed positioning to place components on the page (such as a sidebar or header), or they use javascript to lay out certain items vertically on the page. While we have done everything possible to make this plugin as compatible with as many themes as possible, it is impossible to work perfectly with every theme (Twenty Fourteen is a great example, since it uses a fixed positioned header).

###X Feature is not working. What should I do?
